## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ âœ¨
I am very much interested in pursuing a successful career in software industry. Currently I am pursuing BS in Physics. Though I am not a CSE major, I engage myself in learning new technology regarding software industry whenever I can manage time. Besides academic study, I love to explore vast knowledge in programming, software development and computer engineering. As soon as my bachelor programme ends, I want to start a promising career in software industry.
